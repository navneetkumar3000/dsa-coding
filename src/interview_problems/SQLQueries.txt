1.Find all employees (employee_name, course_name & score)
Solution :- MySQL/PostgresSQL
SELECT
    e.employee_name,
    c.course_name,
    r.score
FROM TrainingResults r
JOIN Employees e
    ON r.employee_id = e.employee_id
JOIN TrainingCourses c
    ON r.course_id = c.course_id
ORDER BY e.employee_name, c.course_name;

2.Employees Who Passed (score ≥ 50)
Solution :- MySQL/PostgresSQL
SELECT
    e.employee_name,
    c.course_name,
    r.score
FROM TrainingResults r
JOIN Employees e
    ON r.employee_id = e.employee_id
JOIN TrainingCourses c
    ON r.course_id = c.course_id
WHERE r.score >= 50
ORDER BY e.employee_name;

3.Employees With No Training Taken
Solution :- MySQL/PostgresSQL
SELECT
    e.employee_name
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN TrainingResults r
    ON e.employee_id = r.employee_id
WHERE r.employee_id IS NULL;


4.Employees With Their Courses (Including No Course)
Solution :- MySQL/PostgresSQL
SELECT
    e.employee_name,
    c.course_name,
    r.score
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN TrainingResults r
    ON e.employee_id = r.employee_id
LEFT JOIN TrainingCourses c
    ON r.course_id = c.course_id
ORDER BY e.employee_name;

5.Highest Score Per Employee
Solution :- MySQL/PostgresSQL
SELECT
    e.employee_name,
    MAX(r.score) AS highest_score
FROM Employees e
JOIN TrainingResults r
    ON e.employee_id = r.employee_id
GROUP BY e.employee_name;

6.Highest Score Per Course
Solution :- MySQL/PostgresSQL
SELECT
    c.course_name,
    MAX(r.score) AS highest_score
FROM TrainingCourses c
JOIN TrainingResults r
    ON c.course_id = r.course_id
GROUP BY c.course_name;

7.Employees Who Took More Than One Course
Solution :- MySQL/PostgresSQL
SELECT
    e.employee_name,
    COUNT(r.course_id) AS course_count
FROM Employees e
JOIN TrainingResults r
    ON e.employee_id = r.employee_id
GROUP BY e.employee_name
HAVING COUNT(r.course_id) > 1;

8.Course With Average Score
Solution :- MySQL/PostgresSQL
SELECT
    c.course_name,
    AVG(r.score) AS avg_score
FROM TrainingCourses c
JOIN TrainingResults r
    ON c.course_id = r.course_id
GROUP BY c.course_name;

9.Rank Employees by Score (Per Course)
Solution :- MySQL/PostgresSQL
SELECT
    e.employee_name,
    c.course_name,
    r.score,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY c.course_name ORDER BY r.score DESC) AS rank
FROM TrainingResults r
JOIN Employees e
    ON r.employee_id = e.employee_id
JOIN TrainingCourses c
    ON r.course_id = c.course_id;

10.Employees Who Failed Any Course (score < 50)
Solution :- MySQL/PostgresSQL
SELECT DISTINCT
    e.employee_name
FROM Employees e
JOIN TrainingResults r
    ON e.employee_id = r.employee_id
WHERE r.score < 50;
